A restaurant management system is a type of software that has been specifically designed for use within the restaurant industry.
Also known as restaurant management software, such solutions are intended to assist leaders and others in carrying out the most critical managerial tasks.
A system of this type may be a comprehensive all-in-one solution, including elements of a point-of-sale system, such as payment processing,
with more complex back-end features, such as workforce management, inventory management, and a booking or reservations system. However, 
some restaurant management systems focus on specific areas.
